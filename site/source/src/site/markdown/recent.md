# New Features

As items are implemented from our road map, they are moved here to track the progress we've made:

1. **[Table Sampling](tablesample.html)**. Support the <code>TABLESAMPLE</code> clause by implementing a filter that uses the guideposts established by stats gathering to only return a percentage of the rows. **Available in our 4.12 release**
1. **[Reduce on disk storage](https://phoenix.apache.org/columnencoding.html)**. Reduce on disk storage to improve performance by a) packing all values into a single cell per column family and b) provide an indirection between the column name and the column qualifier. **Available in our 4.10 release**
1. **[Atomic update](https://phoenix.apache.org/atomic_upsert.html)**. Atomic update is now possible in the UPSERT VALUES statement in support of counters and other use cases. **Available in our 4.9 release**
6. **[DEFAULT declaration](https://phoenix.apache.org/language/index.html#column_def)**. When defining a column it is now possible to provide a DEFAULT declaration for the initial value. **Available in our 4.9 release**
1. **[Namespace Mapping](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-1311)**. Maps Phoenix schema to HBase namespace to improve isolation between different schemas. **Available in our 4.8  release**
1. **[Hive Integration](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-2743)**. Enables Hive to be used with Phoenix in support of joining huge tables to other huge tables. **Available in our 4.8  release**
1. **[Local Index Improvements](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-1734)**. Reworked local index implementation to guarantee colocation of table and index data and use supported HBase APIs for better maintainability. **Available in our 4.8  release**
1. **[DISTINCT Query Optimization](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-258)**. Push seek logic to server for SELECT DISTINCT and COUNT DISTINCT queries over the leading parts of the primary key leading to dramically better performance. **Available in our 4.8  release**
1. **[Transaction Support](transactions.html)**. Supports transactions by integrating with [Tephra](https://github.com/continuuity/tephra). **Available in our 4.7  release**
1. **[Time series Optimization](rowtimestamp.html)**. Optimizes queries against time series data as explained in more detail [here](https://blogs.apache.org/phoenix/entry/new_optimization_for_time_series). **Available in our 4.6  release**
1. **[Asynchronous Index Population](secondary_indexing.html#Asynchronous_Index_Population)**. Enables an index to be created asynchronously using a map reduce job. **Available in our 4.5 release**
2. **[User Defined Functions](udf.html)**. Allows users to create and deploy their own custom or domain-specific user-defined functions to the cluster. **Available in our 4.4 release**
1. **[Functional Indexes](secondary_indexing.html#Functional_Indexes)**. Enables an index to be defined as expressions as opposed to just column names and have the index be used when a query contains this expression. **Available in our 4.3 release**
2. **[Map-reduce Integration](phoenix_mr.html)**. Support general map-reduce integration to Phoenix by implementing custom input and output formats. **Available in our 3.3/4.3 release**
1. **[Statistics Collection](update_statistics.html)**. Collects the statistics for a table to improve query parallelization. **Available in our 3.2/4.2 release**
2. **[Join Improvements](joins.html)**. Improve existing hash join implementation.
    * **[Many-to-many joins](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-1179)**. Support joins where both sides are too large to fit into memory. **Available in our 3.3/4.3 release**
    * **[Optimize foreign key joins](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-852)**. Optimize foreign key joins by leveraging our skip scan filter. **Available in our 3.2/4.2 release**
    * **[Semi/anti joins](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-167)**. Support semi/anti subqueries through the standard [NOT] IN and [NOT] EXISTS keywords. **Available in our 3.2/4.2 release**
3. **[Subqueries](subqueries.html)** Support independent subqueries and correlated subqueries in the WHERE clause as well as subqueries in the FROM clause. **Available in our 3.2/4.2 release**
1. **[Tracing](tracing.html)**. Allows visibility into the various steps of an <code>UPSERT</code> or <code>SELECT</code> statement along with how long each step took across all the machines in your cluster. **Available in our 4.1 release**
2. **[Local Indexing](secondary_indexing.html#Local_Indexing)**. A new, complementary indexing stragegry for _write heavy_, _space constrained_ use cases. With local indexes, index and table data co-reside on same server so no network overhead occurs during writes. Local indexes can be used even when the query isnâ€™t fully covered (i.e. Phoenix automatically retrieve the columns not in the index through point gets against the data table). **Available in our 4.1 release**
8. **[Derived Tables](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PHOENIX-136)**. Allows a <code>SELECT</code> clause to be used in the FROM clause to define a _derived_ table (including join queries). **Available in our 3.1/4.1 release**
9. **[Apache Pig Loader](pig_integration.html#Pig_Loader)** . Support for a Pig loader to leverage the performance of Phoenix when processing data through Pig. **Available in our 3.1/4.1 release**
2. **[Views](views.html)**. Allows the creation of multiple tables using the same physical HBase table. **Available in our 3.0/4.0 release**
3. **[Multi-tenancy](multi-tenancy.html)**. Allows independent views to be created by different tenants on a per-connection basis that all share the same physical HBase table. **Available in our 3.0/4.0 release**
2. **[Sequences](sequences.html)**. Support for CREATE/DROP SEQUENCE, NEXT VALUE FOR, and CURRENT VALUE FOR has been implemented. **Available in our 3.0/4.0 release**
4. **[ARRAY Type](array_type.html)**. Support for the standard JDBC ARRAY type. **Available in our 3.0/4.0 release**
1. **[Secondary Indexes](secondary_indexing.html)**. Allows users to create indexes over mutable or immutable data.
2. **[Paged Queries](paged.html)**. Paged queries through row value constructors, a standard SQL construct to efficiently locate the row at or after a composite key value. Enables a query-more capability to efficiently step through your data and optimizes IN list of composite key values to be point gets.
3. **[CSV Bulk Loader](bulk_dataload.html)**. Bulk load CSV files into HBase either through map-reduce or a client-side script.
2. **Aggregation Enhancements**. <code>COUNT DISTINCT</code>, <code>PERCENTILE</code>, and <code>STDDEV</code> are now supported.
4. **Type Additions**. The <code>FLOAT</code>, <code>DOUBLE</code>, <code>TINYINT</code>, and <code>SMALLINT</code> are now supported.
2. **IN/OR/LIKE Optimizations**. When an IN (or the equivalent OR) and a LIKE appears in a query using the leading row key columns, compile it into a skip scanning filter to more efficiently retrieve the query results.
3. **Support ASC/DESC declaration of primary key columns**. Allow a primary key column to be declared as ascending (the default) or descending such that the row key order can match the desired sort order (thus preventing an extra sort).
3. **Salting Row Key**. To prevent hot spotting on writes, the row key may be *"salted"* by inserting a leading byte into the row key which is a mod over N buckets of the hash of the entire row key. This ensures even distribution of writes when the row key is a monotonically increasing value (often a timestamp representing the current time).
4. **TopN Queries**. Support a query that returns the top N rows, through support for ORDER BY when used in conjunction with TopN.
6. **Dynamic Columns**. For some use cases, it's difficult to model a schema up front. You may have columns that you'd like to specify only at query time. This is possible in HBase, in that every row (and column family) contains a map of values with keys that can be specified at run time. So, we'd like to support that.
7. **Apache Bigtop Inclusion**. See [BIGTOP-993](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-993) for more information.
